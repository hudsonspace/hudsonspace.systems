    q: 'What is your mission?',
    a: 'We\'re designing a faster future today. Made in Hoboken, NJ, we\'re Hudson Space Systems. Our goal is to make access to microgravity research and manufacturing simple and affordable.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What is microgravity?',
    a:
      'It’s weightlessness (pretty much). When something is in space, in orbit, or in freefall, gravity is no longer a force to be resisted. That’s why objects appear to be floating in space.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why do I need weightless conditions?',
    a:
      'These environments offer incredible opportunities to learn about and research phenomena not easily observed on Earth. From corporate researchers investigating petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors to academic researchers investigating microbiology and stem cells, many are already experimenting in space. Microgravity is already accelerating and widening R&D for companies today.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can I access microgravity?',
    a:
      'Well... that’s the problem. The launch providers currently servicing this market are already operating at capacity, with extremely long lead times and sky high prices, which also means there are few chances for iterative experimentation. Because of this, opportunities to research in microgravity are limited.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can Hudson Space help this research?',
    a:
      'Bringing together a team of quirky rocket scientists, we’ve developed and built an innovative, fully-reusable launch platform. We can increase launch frequencies, lower costs, and remove the traditional barriers to sending experiments in space. We’re using our affordable and streamlined suborbital rocket technology to offer rides to space (and back) for research payloads, on a dependable schedule and at attainable rates.',
