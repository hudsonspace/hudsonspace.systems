    q: 'What’s your mission?',
    a: 'We want to enable the next industrial revolution in space! The time is right, and all of the technology is available. We’re putting together the pieces to build the first layer of in-space infrastructure.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is microgravity?',
    a:
      'It’s weightlessness (pretty much). When something is in space, in orbit, or in freefall, gravity is no longer a force to be resisted. That’s why objects appear to be floating in space.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why do I need weightless conditions?',
    a:
      'These environments offer incredible opportunities to learn about and research phenomena not easily observed on Earth. From corporate researchers investigating petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors to academic researchers investigating microbiology and stem cells, many are already experimenting in space. Microgravity is already accelerating and widening R&D for companies today.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can I access microgravity?',
    a:
      'Well... that’s the problem. The launch providers currently servicing this market are already operating at capacity, with extremely long lead times and sky high prices, which also means there are few chances for iterative experimentation. Because of this, opportunities to research in microgravity are limited.',

  {
    q: 'How can Hudson Space Systems help me?',
    a:
      'Hudson Space Systems builds and integrates a stack of aerospace technologies to provide an end-to-end space access service. We call it Microgravity as a Service™, and its goal is to eliminate existing barriers (cost, supply, complexity, etc.) for academic and corporate STEM customers alike. The result is simplified access to microgravity for advanced research/development/manufacturing.',
